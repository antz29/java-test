# Java Exercise

This is a simple exercise done by Mehmet Sibar. The application can run via command line. It will ask a few questions to fill the shopping cart.  At the end of it, the application should show your cart and the total price.

It's best to run the test to see how the application performs.

The command-line interface has not designed very well as the main focus is the code quality and logic.
